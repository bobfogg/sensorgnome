 - Pi-3 boards from some manufacturers are using a new revision
   of the BCM2709 chip, which broke serial number generation.
   (This requires changes to the root filesystem, which are tracked
   in the `root` directory.)

 - an external hub can be plugged into the Pi 2/3's USB port 4, to allow
   for a total of 10 USB ports.  Supported hubs are 
   - DLink DUB H7, revisions B, C, D
   - BIG-7 hub (as sold by uugear.com)
   Port numbering is 1, 2, 3 on Pi, then 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 on external
   hub.
